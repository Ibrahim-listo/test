# Include the .htaccess and .htpasswd files in the root directory
!.htaccess
!.htpasswd

# Include the index.html file in the root directory
!index.html

# Include the public directory and all of its contents
!public/

# Within the public directory, ignore all .php files
public/*/*.php

# But, exclude specific files in the public/css, public/js, and public/images directories
!public/css/*
!public/js/*
!public/images/*
