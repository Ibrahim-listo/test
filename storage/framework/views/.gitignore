# Compiler output files
# ---------------------
# This section specifies the compiler output files that will be generated during the build process.
# These files include object files (*.o), executable files (*.out), and core dump files (*.core).
# Object files contain machine code that is generated from compiling source code files.
# Executable files are created by linking object files together and are ready to be run on the system.
# Core dump files are created when a program crashes and contain a snapshot of the program's memory at the time of the crash.
# These files are important for debugging and understanding the behavior of the program.
#
# Example file names:
#  - my_program.o
#  - my_program.out
#  - my_program.core
