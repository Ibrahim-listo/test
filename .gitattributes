# .gitignore

# This file is used by Git to ignore certain files and directories in the project, 
# preventing them from being tracked and committed to the repository.

# Laravel
# The following lines ignore various directories and files specific to Laravel, 
# a popular PHP framework. This helps keep the repository clean and focused on 
# the application code.
/public/assets
/storage/*.key
/storage/framework/cache/*
/storage/framework/sessions/*
/storage/framework/views/*
/storage/logs/*

# Laravel Ignored Files
# These extensions and directories are ignored because they are generated 
# automatically and can be recreated as needed.
composer.lock
node_modules/
yarn.lock

# settings and metadata. Ignoring these files helps prevent conflicts and 
# unnecessary bloat in the repository.

# repository.

# a front-end build tool for Laravel, are not ignored. This allows these files to 
# be tracked and deployed with the application.
